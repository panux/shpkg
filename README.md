# shpkg (WIP)
A package manager written in shell script

# __WARNING: WIP SOFTWARE__
This package manager is incomplete and mostly untested. Please do not use this in production or run it directly in your root filesystem. This should only be tested INSIDE a docker container for safety reasons (if the container gets messed up, you can just delete it).
